# React 19 Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The `cmdk` package (version 1.0.0) has a peer dependency constraint requiring React 18, which conflicts with our React 19 upgrade. This was causing Vercel build failures with the following error:

```
npm error peer react@"^18.0.0" from cmdk@1.0.0
npm error Conflicting peer dependency: react@18.3.1
```

## Solution
1. **Removed cmdk dependency** from package.json
2. **Created stub implementation** of Command components in `components/ui/command.tsx`
3. **Added .npmrc** with `legacy-peer-deps=true` as a fallback for other potential conflicts

## Impact
- The Command UI components are now basic HTML implementations without the advanced functionality from cmdk
- If command palette functionality is needed in the future, consider:
  - Upgrading to cmdk v2 when React 19 support is added
  - Using an alternative command palette library
  - Implementing custom command palette functionality

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Removed cmdk dependency
- `components/ui/command.tsx` - Stub implementation
- `.npmrc` - Added legacy peer deps flag

This fix ensures Vercel deployment succeeds while maintaining component API compatibility.
